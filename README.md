# Median-Finding
This repository contains three algorithms written in Python. The first labeled as algo1 uses a recursive randomized selection to find a median of a list. The second labeled as algo2 uses deterministic selection to find a median of a list. It also reads in numbers from a text file and creates a list from them. The third labeled as algo3 is an implementation of quicksort to find the k'th smallest element in a list. For algo3, simply create your own list or uncomment the sample lists to test with those.
